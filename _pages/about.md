I'm a 2nd year PhD candidate in the Wells group at Northwestern University. I'm interested in biological nutrient removal and recovery. Currently, I am working on a project to design and operate a lab-scale CANDO+P reactor. This reactor enriches denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms to remove phosphorus and recover nitrogen as nitrous oxide as a biogas. I am also working on bioinformatics projects to study nitrogen removal metabolisms and dabbling in phage as a biocontrol strategy in wastewater treatment systems. 

In my free time, I love hiking, playing video games, and bingeing reality tv!
